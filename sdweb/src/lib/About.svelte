		<p class="text-lg font-semibold">
			Stiwdio Dyfi represents the first small steps in a large
			ambition: to instigate and sustain a film and media industry in the Dyfi Biosphere.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stiwdio Dyfi CIC is a regeneration project operating within the UNESCO Dyfi Biosphere area in
			Mid-West Wales, with a studio facility at Y Plas, Machynlleth.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have an ethos of inclusion, accessibility and sustainability outlined in our CIC36
			manifesto.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stiwdio Dyfi was set up to give the local economy a boost through providing cultural spaces and outlets
			that complement existing infrastructure and enterprise.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our aim is to initiate and facilitate creative spaces and outlets to enhance creative economy
			opportunity in the Dyfi Biosphere.
